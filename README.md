> 🚨 This package was created because of this issue: laravel/passport#382 . But the new version of passport has officially solved this issue at: laravel/passport#1447, so I think we can stop needing this package.

Make [laravel/passport](https://github.com/laravel/passport) client cacheable.

## Installing

```shell
$ composer require overtrue/laravel-passport-cache-client -vvv
```

## Usage

Thanks to Laravel's automatic package discovery mechanism, you don't need to do any additional operations.

Of course, you can also control the cache strategy freely, just need to configure the following in the configuration file:

**config/passport.php**
```php
return [
    //...
    'cache' => [
        // Cache key prefix
        'prefix' => 'passport_',
        
        // The lifetime of passport cache(seconds).
        'expires_in' => 300,
        
        // Cache tags
        'tags' => [],
    ],
];
```
